        My name is Ragesh and I am from California.
        I have been working as a software backend engineer for the last 15 years.
        My main area of expertise is data and database technologies. In the last
        few years there has been a lot happening in this space and I am here to take you
        though some interesting observations I have made during the time spent on exploring
        these technologies. In other areas of technology I have been using Java as my programming
        language for the past few years. I have never worked on web development and
        I always felt this as something I lack in terms of experience and this is
        why I have decided to set myself a goal to learn a few web technologies in the
        next couple of years and see where it takes me.
      </p>

        Outside of this my other
        areas of interest include movies, working out and poetry :), checkout my
        <a href="https://www.poemhunter.com/ragesh-damodaran/" target="_blank">poems</a>. I was born
        in India and spent my early adulthood in India, I came to US in 2012 to work on
        a project I was leading. My parent are from the south of India in a state
        called Kerala and I also attended a college in Kerala. Its a very beautify place with
        a lot of greenary, beaches and backwaters, the closest thing to Kerala I have seen is Hawaii
        . Check out these pics from my place.
